## Can a Volunteer Examiner (VE) join existing teams using ExamTools?

Yes. Go into the `#arrl` channel in Discord and volunteer. Several team
leads monitor the channel and will get in touch, especially if they
are short-handed.

## I am already using ExamTools with another VEC. How do I get added as an ARRL VE?

First, make sure you are accredited with ARRL VEC. If you are not, then go to http://www.arrl.org/become-an-arrl-ve to sign up.
Once you are listed at http://www.arrl.org/ve-session-counts, ExamTools will synced and updated your profile. Then, your team lead will be able to add you to their ExamTools session. View your accrediations in ExamTools under your Profile found in the upper left corner when logged into ExamTools.

## Is there a checklist of what my VE team needs to do to get started with ExamTools?

* Make sure all your VEs have signed up for an ExamTools Account and have verified by uploading an offical copy of their current license.
* Decide on a video-platform for team training (and remote testing, if you'll be offering it).
* Familiar your team with ExamTools by training in the sandbox (requires another account on the dev server) and visiting remote teams.
* Create a Team Account in ExamTools.
* Create a sessions for your exam.
* Set up a method of payment. Or you can accept cash the day of for in-person exams.
* Print exams and answer sheets, if doing in-person.
* Purchase or borrow tablets or computers for in-person electronic exams.
 

## Is there a procedure for verifying that ARRL is good with us doing online exams?
Receipt of instructions via email from Maria is the approval for ExamTools and video sessions.
You must apply for permission by contacting the VEC, but be aware of these requirements before you apply:

_ARRL VE teams must meet the following criteria and adhere to the
following rules/policies to participate in the Video sessions
program. Long-standing, well established teams with a history of
adhering to the highest degree of examination integrity, and that
consistently submit accurate exam documents consistent with ARRL VEC
standards will be selected to participate._

The team should follow up with the VEC when ready to go live to
receive the confidential session document upload
instructions. However, if they have been training and are able to get
the upload instructions from a trained team, that would be acceptable.

Make sure you, the CVE (VE Team Liaison), do the following:
* Follow the instructions in Maria's email.
* Sign up for the VE Discord chat here: https://discord.gg/CsKrBmA
* Read through exam.tools [CVE documentation]({{< relref "../cve/" >}}), if you have questions you can ask them in the Discord `#arrl` channel.
* Register in the sandbox at http://hamstudy.dev/ and then login at https://beta.examtools.dev/ with your
  team members. DO NOT use a Facebook or Google login: Make a "real" user.
  There's more info in [getting an exam.tools and sandbox account]({{< relref "../ve/getexamtoolsaccount/" >}})
* Volunteer in the Discord `#arrl` channel to help out with another team's ARRL VEC session so you get
  to see the real system in action.
* Forward your approval email from the ARRL/VEC to verifications@examtools.org
  making sure to note your call sign, username and email address.
  This will result in your Examtools membership being upgraded from VE to CVE (liaison).

## How do I collect candidate exam fee payments?

At this time, Examtools does not provide for any payment
processing. You will need to establish a mechanism for requesting and
collecting payments and keeping track of who has paid – preferably
before or during the exam session – and sending payment to the VEC as
appropriate.

Many teams use the registration confirmation email "Note to applicant" field found in the session listing to including additional info in the email which ExamTools sends (i.e.payment information, Zoom meeting details and
other exam details) or may send a separate email with this information. Teams typically use online personal payment processors like Venmo,
PayPal, Square, Zelle, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc. or even have candidates
mail them personal checks! You can get the candidate's email address
from the MANAGE dropdown `Edit Applicant` on the candidate in your session.

## Can I get reimbursed for expenses like Zoom Pro and PayPal transaction fees?

Yes. Simply keep records of your "necessary and prudent" expenses
required to run the exam session and retain up to $7 per applicant. You may keep all of the $5 from a youth exam.
Remember the [limit](http://www.arrl.org/arrl-vec-exam-fees)
of up to \$7 per candidate. For a monthly fee
like that of Zoom Pro, prorate it over several exam sessions if the
expense exceeds the per candidate limit for a single session. See
Retaining A Portion of the Fees on page 61 of the VE Manual for
complete rules and record-keeping requirements.


## What if a registered candidate fails to pay the fee?

It is entirely possible that some candidates will register for a
session, not pay and not respond to your attempts to contact them. The registration email could have gonew to their spam folder.  Try calling or texting, but if you decide that you need to cancel their
registration, remove them using the MANAGE dropdown `Delete Applicant` on the candidate. This frees up the exam slot for
someone else.

## What happens when a prepaid candidate cancels or doesn't show up?

You should refund the fee if you can. This is easy to do with most
online payment systems. Also don't forget to remove them from the
Examtools roster before submitting the test session package to the
VEC. You do this by deleting them using the MANAGE dropdown `Delete Applicant` on the candidate before
Finalizing the session. See the next question if your team policy is
to retain fees for no-shows:

## How are retained fees for pre-registered no-shows handled?

The no-show candidate fees can be listed separately in "other fees collected"
or all test fees could be added together. VE teams are
allowed to retain up to \$7 per candidate for reasonable expenses
including the no-shows. No-show candidates that are not refunded the
test fee could be listed on the roster or a note should be included
explaining the additional fee. Candidates that give the team ample
time to schedule another candidate in their vacated time slot should
be refunded. See above. See page 61 of the VE Manual for complete
rules and record-keeping requirements for retained fees.

## How do I send the exam fees to the VEC?

The team has three choices: Call and pay with Credit Card per session, keep a credit card on file or mail a check.

The VE team may keep a credit card on file with the VEC department to pay for the exam session fees. Contact
the VEC to make arrangements. Do not email your credit card
information.

When sending/mailing the exam fees checks, teams should please
include the test date and location and the VE team leader’s name, call
sign, and contact information for reference so we can match it to the
session.

The ARRL/VEC's mailing address is:

```
ARRL/VEC
225 MAIN ST
NEWINGTON CT 06111-9825
```

## Can I charge more (or less) than the \$15 ARRL VEC fee?

No.

FCC Rules require VEC organizations to agree to assure that, for any
examination, every examinee qualified under these rules is registered
without regard to race, sex, religion, national origin or membership
(or lack thereof) in any amateur service organization.

The ARRL exam fee cannot be increased, reduced, or waived; the fee is
to be applied uniformly throughout the calendar year to ensure every
applicant is treated equally and without discrimination.

The exam fee cannot be increased for a particular group of
applicants. Therefore, teams should hold back a portion of each \$15
exam fee to offset a credit card company’s payment fee. The exam fee
should be not increased to offset the credit card fees.

## A candidate cancels and says "keep the fee as a donation". What do I do?

Return it.

Donations/solicitations are not allowed.

FCC Rule:  Administering VE requirements:

_§97.509 (e) No VE may administer or certify any examination by
fraudulent means or for monetary or other consideration including
reimbursement in any amount in excess of that permitted. Violation of
this provision may result in the revocation of the grant of the VE's
amateur station license and the suspension of the grant of the VE's
amateur operator license._

Soliciting, asking for donations, or offering free material to
candidates would have the appearance of impropriety.

This is to ensure the integrity of the examination process.

## Can my VE team or club solicit donations in conjunction with our VE activities?

No. See above.

## How should I prepare my session to upload to the VEC?

Once you receive the confidential uploading documentation, you will
need to upload the VEC ARCHIVE (includes PDF of Final Forms and JSON) from ExamTools. Any Youth Grant Reinbursement Forms, CSCEs, or other documentation should be selected and loaded at the same time, but not included in the VEC Archive.  Leave the VEC Archive zipped. You should not submit the ARRL Test Session report when using ExamTools.  Everything the VEC needs is in the VEC ARCHIVE.
 The following is a screen shot of the upload page:

![ARRL/VEC Upload](./images/upload.png)


## Can EBF files be uploaded to ARRL/VEC?

Instead of an EBF file, the VEC uses the JSON file which is already included in the VEC ARCHIVE. As described above.

## Do we still have to provide FCC license copies in the uploaded package? CSCEs?

License copies are not needed. You do need to include a copy of only
the front of any pending CSCEs. But do an [FRN lookup](https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchLicense.jsp) ahead of the
exam. Odds are the 605 for which the CSCE is for will already have
been acted upon by the time the exam session happens.

## How do I process a "paper upgrade" with or without an exam?

The candidate registers for your exam session and provides proof to you of any element credit. 
Consult the [ARRL Exam Element Credit Information](http://www.arrl.org/exam-element-credit) for what is acceptable proof.

You will enter the credit(s) using the exam.tools MANAGE dropdown `Add Credit` for the candidate. Make sure you handle the case of expired Amateur Extra by giving both Element 3 and Element 4 credit.

* If the candidate has no current license they need to take the Element 2 exam. Upon passing, the candidate does the usual signature process.

* If the candidate already has a current license and thus is not taking an actual exam, you need to move the candidate Status from `registered` or `seen` to `ready to sign`. The candidate logs into the session using their pin and is presented with the usual signature process.

After the 3 VEs assigned to the candidate have signed and the candidate is marked complete, exam.tools generates the proper forms reflecting these credits.

You will submit the proof documents for the candidate together with the VEC ARCHIVE at the end of the session.

## What do we sign when a candidate fails? How do we prove the failed exam happened?

There is nothing to sign. Proof of failure is that Final Forms contains the candidate roster showing failed
element(s) and the candidate's results sheet showing a failing
score. 

In traditional in-person exams, the candidate usually fills out the
605 in advance of the exam in order to streamline the process at the
end of the session and so the VEs can confirm candidate identity
matches their photo ID. In that case, it is common practice to either
return the unsigned 605 to the candidate [per 97.509(i)] or to send it
to the VEC, possibly signed but with the NO NEW LICENSE OR UPGRADE WAS
EARNED box checked.

However, it is acceptable [citation?] for a candidate to only fill out
their 605 after successful completion of the exam element(s) and then
the VEs sign it and send it to the VEC [97.509(l)].

Examtools implements this practice by not generating a 605 (and CSCE)
until after the candidate's new license or upgrade is earned and the
candidate is Finalized. The information typically found on the 605
and/or candidate roster for traditional exam sessions is collected at
the point of candidate registration in Hamstudy.org
[97.17(b)(1): "...The VEs may collect all necessary information
in any manner of their choosing, including creating their own forms."]

## Can answers be provided to candidates?

Yes for randomly-generated exams like ExamTools prepares but not for
in-person exams using ARRL/VEC pre-printed exam booklets.  For the
online exam setting we can be more flexible because all exams are
randomly generated and examinees wouldn’t be retested with the exact
same question set.

Moving forward, ARRL will allow candidates to be given their results
sheets for randomly generated tests, if the team chooses. This would
apply to online as well as in-person sessions when randomly generated
examinations are used.
