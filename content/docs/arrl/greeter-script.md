**BEGIN Recorded Video Script**

We ask that you please bear with us as we refine the process for
performing a fully-remote proctored exam. The process may seem onerous
and somewhat invasive. It may seem like we suspect that each candidate
might try to cheat. The CUARC VE team did not come up with the
complete process and requirements, but we have a liability to uphold
the trust put in us.


Before we begin, some additional reminders:
1. Make sure you have your photo ID handy.
2. Ensure you are 100% focused during the entire exam session.
3. Any distractions or anomalies could be cause to void the exam at the sole discretion of the VE Team. Anomalies include, but are not limited to:
   1. Notable distraction by you, such as eyes not remaining on the exam and/or wandering around the room, or any noises.
   2. Your appearing to reference or use unauthorized materials (e.g. looking at cell phone, even just the lock screen, changing windows on computer, etc.)
   3. Another person entering the exam space (on camera, physically, or audibly).
   4. Your getting up or leaving the room during the exam.
4. Once you start the exam, the Volunteer Examiners will all turn off their video and audio so as to not distract you – but we’ll be listening and watching. Please leave your audio and video on. Give us a shout if you need anything and when you are ready for grading click the "grade exam" button and let us know you are ready.
5. Make sure to answer all the questions: Only correct answers add points; incorrect answers don't subtract, so it's best to guess rather than leave an answer blank. Good luck with the exam


Please respond to the next questions, and, if you don’t agree or can't comply, we'll end this now and refund your fee.
