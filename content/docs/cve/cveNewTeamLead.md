## Before getting started

Confirm your Team Lead status in ExamTools.  Login to http://exam.tools, go to your Profile (upper left on the navigation), and then expand Volunteer Examiner Credentials. You must have Team Lead associated with the VEC under which you plan to run exam sessions.  If you only see Volunteer Examiner, please reach out to your VEC to get permission to run exams as a Team Lead with ExamTools. Most VECs will update ExamTools automatically and you should only have to wait for the new permissions to sync within a few hours of being approved. 

Now that you are a new VE Team Lead looking to get started with ExamTools, here are our recommended steps:

## For in-person paper template graded sessions
* Read through this documentation, including the [Getting Started guide]({{<relref "../general/gettingStarted">}}) and [Print and Grade Hard Copy Exams]({{<relref "printedExamCreation.md">}}) pages.

## For GradeCam, computer-based, or fully remote sessions
* Read through this documentation and watch the videos provided.
* Get yourself setup in the [**Sandbox**]({{<relref "../general/websiteDecoder.md">}}) environment by following [these instructions]({{<relref "../ve/getExamtoolsAccount.md#follow-these-steps-to-create-an-account-for-use-with-examtools-sandbox--training-environment">}})
  * Optional: Set up two or more of your more experienced VEs who you would like to bring along on this journey using the same steps. If you do not have VEs who can train with you in the sandbox environment, you can use [ dummy VEs ]({{<relref "cveSandboxDummies.md">}}) referenced in the instructions.
* Set up sample sessions and practice registering candidates, running the exam, and get yourself comfortable with the ExamTools.
* Ask in the appropriate VEC channel on the Discord to shadow another team already running live exams.
* Still not VE Team Lead? If you are ready to run real exams in the [production environment]({{<relref "../general/websiteDecoder.md">}}), get explicit permission from your VEC to run fully-remote or in-person exams using ExamTools.  
* At this point you will need to get all VEs on your team set up in the [production environment]({{<relref "../general/websiteDecoder.md">}}) to assist with your exams. Have them follow [these instructions]({{<relref "../ve/getExamtoolsAccount.md">}}) for the live environment.
* Create your first real exam session in the [production environment]({{<relref "../general/websiteDecoder.md">}}) and run your session!
* For in-person sessions using GradeCam or devices, check out [In-Person Exams with ExamTools]({{<relref "/cveIn-PersonExamProcess.md">}}) documentation.
