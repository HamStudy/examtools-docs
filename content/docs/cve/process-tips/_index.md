## Process Tip #1: ExamTools Training Videos

ExamTools [Training Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDxsQ4bjUNnppBmsjEE9vad-ZuQonD8Bp)
are available for teams wanting to reference
the new work flow and processes. (Note that we're still in beta, so
some things have already been updated since these videos were
made).


[Here is the one particularly important video](https://youtu.be/KoImr4UtMPE) for VE Team Leads to
share with their VEs and any other ExamTools Beta User: How to be a
VE for a Fully-Remote Exam using ExamTools Tier 2 and Zoom! Please
share it with your teams!

## Process Tip #2: Web Site Decoder

There are a LOT of websites! Here's the decoder to help you figure out where you want to be:

* PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT (real sessions, no playing around here):
  * https://hamstudy.org/ - Production Website for creating real accounts
  * https://examtools.org/ - Legacy Production Website for creating/accessing real test sessions
  * https://exam.tools/ or https://beta.examtools.org/ - Tier 2 Production Website for creating/accessing real test sessions

* SANDBOX/DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (use for any training purposes, runs on its own database to avoid any issues with the production environment):
  * https://hamstudy.dev/ - Sandbox environment for creating test accounts
  * https://examtools.dev/ - Legacy Sandbox environment for creating/accessing sandbox test sessions for training/practice/learning
  * https://beta.examtools.dev/ - Tier 2 Sandbox environment for creating/accessing sandbox test sessions for training/practice/learning

* ALPHA
  * https://alpha.exam.tools/ - used by a small group of dev ops; do not use unless you have explicit knowledge of what is happening there.

## Process Tip #3: Getting Started Guide

Here is the [DRAFT "ExamTools Beta Tier 2 Getting Started Guide"](https://bit.ly/2YJqb2p).
Note that this is a living document and is actively being updated to help
guide you through using the new Tier 2 Software.

## Process Tip #4: VE Registration Form

VE Team Leads - We made [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/cD9fTqv5ognik6XC9)
for you to share with the VEs you are on-boarding into the Tier 2 software. Go ahead and send them
this link as it will give them the instructions to walk through in
order for Experienced Support to give them permission to be added to
sessions. We'll be processing the submissions to there as we are able,
but ping Experienced Support if you need any expedited. Thanks!

VE Team Lead - make sure you fill this out yourself, even if you were
setup to use Tier 1, since we need to add the permissions for your VEC
in the new system.

If you would like access to the sandbox / testing platform, fill out
[this form](https://forms.gle/NiAeLFpX7R7E7NZC9) and Experienced Support will get you added.


## Process Tip #5: Setting the VE Number

In Tier 2 we don't (yet) have a way to edit the VE number but you can
edit it in Tier 1/Legacy, so if you have a VE who doesn't have a VE
number you can open T1 (https://examtools.org/) and add them to the
session then edit the number and save it. That will save in Tier 2 as
well. We hope to get those importing automatically in the future for
all participating VECs.

(VE Numbers are used by some VECs but not others.)

## Process Tip #6: Process Flowchart

Nick N1CCK and Marcel AI6MS just made a overview of the
[ExamTools Tier 2 Process Flowchart](https://bit.ly/3etpqkQ) which should help those folks
trying to understand how to use the system. Please check it out and
play with the sandbox beta at https://beta.examtools.dev/


## Process Tip #7: Roles

Here’s a [brief overview of the roles](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Aqg8Vopj2nblhgsJVq8k7yBxhTDk?e=BdXeMm)
within a session, and what each role is currently allowed to do. 

## Process Tip #8: Want a Feature?

For feature requests on ExamTools, please visit
https://features.examtools.org/. You can add your own, or vote for
existing requests

## Process Tip #9: Participating VECs

As of 2020-05-03, we are only aware of the following VECs doing fully-remote testing:

1. GLAARG VEC - Sign up to be a VE with them here: https://glaarg.org/glaarg-forms/ and ask how to get a session approved.
2. W5YI VEC - Contact your CVE to get involved.
3. ARRL VEC - Contact the ARRL/VEC office for more information, visit the #arrl channel, and read
   [this FAQ]({{< relref "../arrl" >}}).

Note 1: You must get explicit approvals from your VEC to administer
fully-remote exams. DO NOT try to do this otherwise, or your session
will likely be rejected/invalidated.

Note 2: Anchorage ARC VEC continues to do [Proctored Remote Testing](https://kl7aa.org/vec/remote-testing/).

## Process Tip #10: How to Run Single & Multi-Room Exams

Here's a nice [step-by-step guide](https://bit.ly/2Bp7NE6) for VEs to use as a reference for how
to run both single-room AND multi-room exam sessions. Special thanks
to Sarah N6OPE for putting this together for GLAARG sessions. Feel
free to use/modify for your teams. (Also note that some of these
nuances are already fixed or being improved in the tool since writing,
so as with all documentation, will be getting updates as the software
matures). 

## Process Tip #11: More Tips for Multi-Room Exam Sessions

We worked with the VE Team from GLAARG to put together a DRAFT
document with some
[tips and procedures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R0Z2DPbaCFeOSwUJnRnQdWe5S7BOLOCrR7QV75IrRTw/edit?usp=sharing)
for running a multi-exam-room session using breakout-rooms in Zoom. Check out:

(This document is open for commenting so we can get more tips from other
teams as well). Special thanks to Norm K6YXH, Loyal, Jonah KJ0NAH,
Grant W4KEK, Lucky225, and Nick N1CCK for
helping put this together!

## Process Tip #12: More Tips for Running Exams Simulatneously

From Todd N7TMS who has been running some W5YI sessions wrote up
this little flow for how he's running remote sessions. Similar to how
GLAARG is doing it too. See below:

There is a lot of chatter about waiting rooms, texting when ready,
shared Google Sheets, etc. We run three exams simultaneously. I
stagger the Zoom appointments -- three every 20 minutes.

When candidates join, they are automatically placed in the Zoom
waiting room. I serve as the host. I bring a candidate into the
"lobby", connect their second device, check that their technology is
functioning adequately, review the rules and regulations, and answer
any questions they have about the process. I also change their screen
name to be their first name and HamStudy PIN. (e.g. Todd 1234)

I have a second device joined to the meeting ... in my case, an
iPad. I assign the iPad to one of the breakout rooms. On my computer,
I can "move" the iPad from room to room. I keep my microphone and
camera muted on the iPad so that I do not interrupt the room as I move
around. This way, I can keep an eye on what is happening in each of
the rooms.

When a room is available, I unmute my mic and camera, move the
candidate to the room, introduce them to the VE team and then mute my
mic and camera as the VEs proceed with the exam.

## Process Tip #13: Zoom Pin Video

From Rick WM6M If you're using Zoom: "when asking the applicant
to show his/her room and ID, click on the applicant's ellipsis (those
three dots) and select "Pin Video". That will make him full screen
regardless of who is speaking while you check the room and ID." One
other suggestion is to put the candidate's screen and video in "split"
mode to see both larger when you are observing as the VE during the
exam

## Process Tip #14: Hybrid In-Person Exams

Courtesy of Nick AA0NM: "So this is the down and dirty [draft of our process](https://bit.ly/2AXUgDl)
(still being refined) that we will be testing out next week
based on how things went this week (and some wishful thinking that a
couple of the suggests we made will be in place). Remember we are
running hybrid in person sessions with computer and paper exams.
Suggestions welcome: 

## Process Tip #15: Markdown for Other Notes

Courtesy of Grant W4KEK: Wanting to know more about what you
can put in your Other Notes box when creating a session? Examtools
uses a format called Markdown, it can do a whole lot, to see some of
the things it can do take a look though

##Process Tip #16: Pre-Check Breakout Room Script

Here's a nice little ["Pre-Check Script"](https://bit.ly/3130hJH) that was made by Connor KD9LSV,
one of the VEs with GLAARG. It's a nice reference
for those groups using a separate pre-check room in Zoom for
candidates before sending them to the Exam Breakout Room.


## Process Tip #17: Discord for Dummies

Here's a ["Discord for Dummies" user guide](https://bit.ly/2ZJAswO) that was put together by
Sarah N6OPE to share with any VEs new to Discord that need a simple
into:

Here's a [2nd document](https://bit.ly/3cdUpRy) as well added on 5/16/20:


## Process Tip #18: Steps for New Team Lead

If you are a new VE Team Lead looking to get started with ExamTools, here are our recommended steps:

1. Read through all the FAQs and watch all the videos

2. Get yourself setup in the Sandbox environment using section “How to create a sandbox account” from the guide listed in FAQ #3)

3. Optional: Set up 2 or more of your more experienced VEs that you would like to bring along on this journey using the same guide
     3a. If you do not have VEs that can train with you in the sandbox environment, you can use dummy VEs referenced in the instructions.

4. Setup sample sessions and practice registering candidates, running the exam, and getting yourself comfortable with the ExamTools system.

5. Ask in the appropriate VEC channel on the Discord to shadow another team already running live exams

6. VE Team Lead - Once you are ready to run real exams in the production environment, get explicit permission from your VEC to run fully-remote or in-person exams using ExamTools and send the confirmation of your approval to verifications@examtools.org

7. At this point you’ll need to get all VEs on your team set up in the production environment to assist with your exams. Send them the sign up form from FAQ #4 to get them registered with ExamTools and configured to help with your session.

8. Create your first real exam session in the production environment and run your session!

9. At any time, use the Discord to ask questions or ping Experienced Support for any specific or urgent needs. We’re all here to help each other out and expand testing for everyone!

## Do Not Share Passwords

From the man, Richard KD7BBC - not a tip, but vital, so I am putting it here so that it does not get lost:

Do not share your password with your team lead. If you have passwords
belonging to your VEs please ask them to reset them. That password
essentially acts as a digital signature -- if you are signing for your
VEs, even just by putting in their password, you are literally forging
their signature.

Do not share your password. Do not let people share their password
with you. If there are significant issues with people understanding
how things work let me know what they are and we'll try to minimize
them, but please please please do not share passwords. This has
already caused an issue where someone who probably didn't intend to do
anything wrong is under investigation because they are suspected of
forging someone else's signature and the issue could quite literally
put our ability to do digital signatures at risk.

Please.


If anyone is unsure of how to reset a password, send them to
https://ham.study/reset HamStudy.org: Reset your password

## COPPA

ExamTools User Please note that all COPPA forms should be sent to
coppa@examtools.org and not to support@examtools.org -- it's not
catestrophic if it goes to the wrong place as they both get to me, but
they get filtered to a different place which makes it harder for me to
verify things if there are questions.

Also note that those instructions and the most up to date version of
the coppa form can be found on the first page of registration.

## Process Tip #19: VE got a new Vanity call sign?

Direct the VE to https://ham.study/profile and have them login with
their examtools login, and update that callsign to their new one.

Ping Experienced Support after setting up the callsign, and
we should be able to do a ULS refresh on examtools.
