## ExamTools Overview

Below are links that will give you an overview of ExamTools and how it is designed to administer Amateur Radio License exams, either in person on paper or computer, or fully remotely via video conferencing software.  While the general requirements as dictated by Part 97 remain the same for each type of exam, the details of how each type of session is administered can vary based on the needs of the exam team.
