This is a brief overview of the several different styles of exam session that can be managed by ExamTools.  In order to know what your first steps in this system should be, verify what type of exam session your team will be running, and follow the steps listed accordingly.

### Getting Started as a VE in a paper-based session using ExamTools exams and paper keys
As a session Volunteer Examiner using paper exams generated by ExamTools that are graded using hard copy test keys, *you will not need to do anything with the ExamTools software*.  Your team lead or designated admin will be logging into the software to print exams and keys either prior to the session or on-demand as candidates register.  All paperwork (including Form 605 and CSCEs) is hard copy.  You will be filling them out and sign via pen and paper.

### Getting Started as a VE in a paper-based session using ExamTools exams and VEC standardized grading keys
As a session Volunteer Examiner using paper exams generated by ExamTools that are graded using a VEC standardized grading key, *you will not need to do anything with the EamTools software*.  Your team lead or designated admin will be logging into the software to print exams and keys either prior to the session or on-demand as candidates register.  All paperwork (including Form 605 and CSCEs) is hard copy.  You will be filling them out and sign via pen and paper.

### Getting Started as a VE using paper-based exams and digital signatures
In order to perform digital signatures on paperwork in ExamTools, you will need to have a verified account on the system and be assigned to the session.  This will enable you to

* Log into an exam session
* Select the applicant who has earned exam credit
* Apply your signature digitally to all documentation

The paperwork can then be printed for signing by the applicant, or digitally signed and emailed.

To sign up for an ExamTools account, follow [this walkthrough]({{<relref "../ve/getExamToolsAccount.md">}}).  To apply signatures on a live test, you will need to set up an account in the [production system]({{<relref "websiteDecoder.md">}}) by following the first section of the walkthrough.  *If your team trains Volunteer Examiners in the [Sandbox environment]({{<relref "websiteDecoder.md">}}) prior to performing live exams, you may also need to follow the steps listed under "Follow these steps to create an account for use with ExamTools Sandbox / Training Environment."  Your team lead will be able to guide you more in that regard.*

### Getting Started as a Volunteer Examiner using paper-based exams and GradeCam grading
The GradeCam grading software integrated into ExamTools allows for an applicant to be digitally registered onto the session roster and have their tests graded quickly and easily by using a standard smartphone or computer webcam.  After grading is complete, the paperwork for successful candidates can be signed digitally or by printing out hard copy of the forms and signing in the traditional manner.  VEs who are grading or signing digitally must have accounts with the ExamTools software.  Any VEs who will be signing manually do not require an account.  Having an account and being assigned to the session will enable you to

* Log into an exam session
* Select the applicant who has earned exam credit
* Apply your signature digitally to all documentation

The paperwork can then be printed for signing by the applicant, or digitally signed and emailed.

To sign up for an ExamTools account, follow [this walkthrough]({{<relref "../ve/getExamToolsAccount.md">}}).  To apply signatures on a live test, you will need to set up an account in the [production system]({{<relref "websiteDecoder.md">}}) by following the first section of the walkthrough.  *If your team trains Volunteer Examiners in the [Sandbox environment]({{<relref "websiteDecoder.md">}}) prior to performing live exams, you may also need to follow the steps listed under "Follow these steps to create an account for use with ExamTools Sandbox / Training Environment."  Your team lead will be able to guide you more in that regard.*

### Getting Started as a Volunteer Examiner in a computer-based session
Many volunteer examiner teams allow candidates to take their license exam on a computer or tablet.  This style of test can be used both in-person or fully remote via video conferencing solutions.  If the exam is given in person, any combination of digital and paper signatures may be used. Fully-remote exams necessitate the use of digital signatures to avoid the need to scan or snail mail hard copy forms. Any actions taken by a VE in this style testing are logged and signed by the software, and so require the VEs to have an account in the system.  Having an account and being assigned to the session will enable you to

* Log into an exam session
* Select the applicant who has earned exam credit
* Apply your signature digitally to all documentation

The paperwork can then be printed for signing by the applicant, or digitally signed and emailed.

To sign up for an ExamTools account, follow [this walkthrough]({{<relref "../ve/getExamToolsAccount.md">}}).  To apply signatures on a live test, you will need to set up an account in the [production system]({{<relref "websiteDecoder.md">}}) by following the first section of the walkthrough.  *If your team trains Volunteer Examiners in the [Sandbox environment]({{<relref "websiteDecoder.md">}}) prior to performing live exams, you may also need to follow the steps listed under "Follow these steps to create an account for use with ExamTools Sandbox / Training Environment."  Your team lead will be able to guide you more in that regard.*
