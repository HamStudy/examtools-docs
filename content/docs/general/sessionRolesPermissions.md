ExamTools allows for the owner of a session to assign roles and permissions to each VE attending.  These range from the Session Owner to monitoring Volunteer Examiners.

* **Owner**: This is the ExamTools user that creates a session.  They are responsible for managing the details of the session itself, including starting, changing, and finalizing the session.

 * **Co-Owner (Team Lead)**: A VE that has been explicitly authorized by the owner of the session to act with full permissions on their behalf.

* **VE Administrator**: A more experienced VE Team Member that is typically a capable decision maker.  They are able to help VE Team Members be assigned correctly, and manage the candidate information.

* **VE Team Member**: VEs that are monitoring exams and signing forms.
