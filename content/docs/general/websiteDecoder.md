## Websites
There are many websites in the ExamTools environment.  They are broken into three primary categories
* **Production Environment** - Use these websites for live test sessions that are intended to be submitted to your VEC.
* **Sandbox / Training Environment** - For training new VEs or troubleshooting and experimenting with known and suspected issues. This environment runs on a database that is isolated from production.  You will need a separate login to use this site.
* **Development** - Both the Production and Sandbox / Training Environments have development stages.  These sites are used for testing new features and bugfixes.  In all cases, expect unexpected results.
