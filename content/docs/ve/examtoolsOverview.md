## Overview of the ExamTools system

ExamTools is designed to make administering Amateur Radio exams a more modernized and streamlined process used for in person and fully remote exam sessions.  Tests can be administered in a web browser on a computer or tablet, manually graded on paper, or graded by a laptop or smartphone camera using GradeCam&trade  grading software.

### User Types
Users of ExamTools are broken into 4 different groups
| User Type | Description |
| Candidate | Candidates are people taking exams. They will log in through a different portal to be presented exams to take, and not see the session management information.|
| Team Lead | Team Leads are VEs that are authorized by the VEC to manage exam sessions.  In the ExamTools system, they are able to create and edit session information, add and remove Volunteer Examiners from the session manifest, edit candidate information as needed, and export all session documents for submission to the VEC. |
| VE Admin | VE Admins are assistants to the Team Lead at a session.  They can help assign other VEs to candidates and edit candidate information as needed. |
| Volunteer Examiners | VEs are standard users in the system.  They are responsible for starting and stopping exams and signing candidate exams. |
