The [ExamTools ecosystem]({{<relref "../general/websiteDecoder.md">}}) has two distinct environments for Volunteer Examiners.  
* The primary website is found at http://exam.tools, and is considered the [Production environment]({{<relref "../general/websiteDecoder.md">}}).  This is where all active Volunteer Examiners need to have an account in order to perform live exams.  
* ExamTools also maintains a [Sandbox environment]({{<relref "../general/websiteDecoder.md">}}) that is used for troubleshooting program errors and general VE training.  This is a separate database, with different user names and passwords from the Production environment.  

## Follow these steps to create an account for use with [ExamTools Production Environment]({{<relref "../general/websiteDecoder.md">}})

* Create an account on [ExamTools](https://exam.tools).  If you have a previously existing [HamStudy](https://hamstudy.org) account, you may skip this step and use the same login information for ExamTools

* You will receive a confirmation email; click the link in the email or enter the number in the email to confirm your account
* Enter your personal details.  For clarity, we recommend using your call sign as the username.
