## Follow these instructions if you have an existing ExamTools account and have now become accredited with one or more additional VECs.

<br />
* Wait until your accreditation is officially confirmed by your additional VEC(s)
* Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/cD9fTqv5ognik6XC9).
  * When you created your initial VE account you were assigned a request ID; when adding additional VEC accreditation, you can simply write "Adding VE Credentials" where the Request ID is required.
* Inform your Team Lead/CVE that you are set up on ExamTools and ready to participate in sessions.
