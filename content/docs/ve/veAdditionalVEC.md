## Adding an additional VEC is automatic in ExamTools, if you have an existing ExamTools account and become accredited with one or more additional VECs.

<br />
* Make sure you already have an ExamTools account and your call sign is current.
* Once your accreditation is officially confirmed by your additional VEC(s), they should add you to a list accessed by ExamTools. 
* Wait until ExamTools syncs with the list. This waiting period could vary depending on the VEC.  If we do not see your new accreditation in a day or two, contact your VEC.
* Confirm your accreditation is active by visiting your Profile at the top of the left navigation menu in ExamTools.  Toward the bottom, look for **Volunteer Examiner Credentials** and click the down caret (arrow) on the right side to expand out and view your accreditations.
* Inform your Team Lead/CVE that your accreditation is displaying in ExamTools and you are ready to participate in sessions.
