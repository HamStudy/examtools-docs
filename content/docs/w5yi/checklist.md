_The following was the W5YI VE Team Checklist as of June 1, 2020._


## Overview of tools we use

We use the following tools:
* ExamTools of course.
* Zoom Pro to run the session.
  * We "record to ccloud or computer" and then save the mp4 file.
* Venmo, Cash App, Zelle and PayPal to collect exam fees.
* My bank account to send exam payment to the W5YI/VEC.  ( most VE's get a Debit card and send the info to W5YI to charge Exam fees to)

## Creating a New Session

* Clone an existing exam session in examtools and update date, confirm max number of candidates.


## Check for candidate registrations on exam day
* Look at https://exam.tools/ve/sessions and check sessions counts. 
* Examtools: Export Applicant List CSV .

## Wait for candidate payment
* Get payment confirmation .
* If a candidate responds with a CSCE.
  * Check ULS to see if no longer needed. If still needed, you'll want to merge it into the session report, below.
* If candidates don't respond with payment before the session, cancel them:
  * delete from examtools.
* Email `03Zoom Invite`
