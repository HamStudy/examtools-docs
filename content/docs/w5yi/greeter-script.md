v4 04/08/2021


_CVE: make sure Zoom is in Gallery view_

_CVE: make sure Security/Allow participants to share screen is enabled._

_CVE: start examtools session_



Before we begin, some additional reminders:
1. Make sure you have your government issued photo ID handy.
2. Ensure you are 100% focused during the entire exam session.
3. Any distractions or anomalies could be cause to void the exam at the sole discretion of the VE Team. Anomalies include, but are not limited to:
   1. Notable distraction by you, such as eyes not remaining on the exam and/or wandering around the room, or any noises.
   2. Your appearing to reference or use unauthorized materials (e.g. looking at cell phone, even just the lock screen, changing windows on computer, etc.)
   3. Another person entering the exam space (on camera, physically, or audibly).
   4. Your getting up or leaving the room during the exam.
4. Once you start the exam, the Volunteer Examiners will turn off their audio so as to not distract you – but we’ll be listening and watching. Please leave your audio and video on. Give us a shout if you need anything and when you are ready for grading click the "grade exam" button and let us know you are ready.
5. Make sure to answer all the questions: Only correct answers add points; incorrect answers don't subtract, so it's best to guess rather than leave an answer blank. Good luck with the exam

* Welcome
* [If the candidate has multiple devices, try to admit the computer first, and the phone next. Instruct the candidate to join
with video only, not audio, on the phone. This is not always possible, because devices in the waiting room will not
always be identifiable by candidate name or device type.]

PASSING GRADE:
* Did you study for the next level exam?
* If “yes,” would you like to take the exam today?
* If “no,” we need to move on to signing the forms before we can submit your license information to W5YI & FCC.
* Click on the “Finish & Sign forms” button to end exam and proceed to signing the documents.
* Review the information on these forms to ensure accuracy.
* There are 2 forms you will be signing; the form “605” and the “CSCE.”
* Click on the Form 605. This is your application to take your exam today. Check your personal information for
accuracy then click close.
* Click on the Form CSCE. This is your Certificate of Successful Completion of Exam. It will have 3 VE signatures
that certify you took and passed your exam. The red “Draft” will be removed after we have signed and Herb has
processed it for sending to you. If that all looks good, you can click on the “Close” button.
* Next, after reading the bulleted items above the signature box; you’ll need to create a digital signature in the box with
your mouse or touchpad.
* Click “sign documents” when done
* Click “Finish session”
* Click “Log Out”
* Stop Screen Sharing at the top of the Zoom window.
* What will happen now is, 3 VEs will sign the forms [done in Exam Tools by clicking on the icon with the pen – Note that
this requires the VE password]. Herb will email the completed CSCE to you and submit the forms to W5YI for processing.
In most cases, you will have your license by the next business day.
* If candidate is in
* Main Room: Click the red “Leave Meeting” button to leave the meeting [one all devices].
* Breakout Room: Click the blue “Leave Room” button, then choose “Leave Meeting” [on all devices].
FAILING GRADE:
* Encourage the candidate to study for the exam at hamstudy.org. Explain the difference between Study Mode and
Practice Exams. [Study Mode will ensure that the candidate sees every question in the question pool, and is drilled more
frequently on questions that they have difficulty with. Practice Exams contain random questions from the question pool,
and there is no guarantee that the candidate will see every question.]
* [Note that 3 VEs must sign the forms even if the candidate fails the exam.]
