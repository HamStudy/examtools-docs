## Can a W5YI VE volunteer join existing teams performing remote exams?

Yes. Go into the `#W5YI` channel in Discord and volunteer. Several team
leads monitor the channel and will get in touch, especially if they
are short-handed.

## I am already an ExamTools VE with another VEC. How do I get added as an W5YI VE?

If you are not accredited as a W5YI VE, you will need to contact a CVE to
get sponsored as a W5YI VE.

Once you have your W5YI Credentials, your W5YI CVE will work you through the
process of adding your W5YI Credentials to your profile.  Your W5YI CVE lead
will then be able to add you to their Exam Tools session once Experienced
Support has updated your profile.

If you haven't participated in any W5YI sessions in recent years, you
may need to contact W5YI-VEC to get updated in their records before you can
participate in online sessions.
